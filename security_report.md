# Security Report: Monad Testnet Automation Tool

## Critical Security Risks

### 1. Private Key Storage
**Risk Level: Critical**

The tool currently stores private keys in plain text files:
- `data/keys_for_faucet.txt`
- `data/private_keys.txt`

**Potential Consequences:**
- Complete loss of funds if files are compromised
- Unauthorized access to accounts
- Potential for malicious actors to drain accounts

**Recommendations:**
1. Use environment variables for private keys
2. Implement encrypted storage using a secure key management system
3. Use hardware wallets for production environments
4. Never commit private keys to version control

### 2. Smart Contract Interactions
**Risk Level: High**

The tool interacts with multiple DEX contracts:
- Bean DEX
- Ambient DEX
- Izumi DEX

**Potential Consequences:**
- Loss of funds due to malicious contracts
- Unauthorized token approvals
- Smart contract vulnerabilities

**Recommendations:**
1. Audit all smart contracts before interaction
2. Implement transaction limits
3. Add confirmation prompts for large transactions
4. Use multi-signature wallets for large operations

### 3. Network Security
**Risk Level: Medium**

The tool connects to the Monad testnet RPC endpoint.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Network downtime
- RPC node compromise

**Recommendations:**
1. Use HTTPS for all RPC connections
2. Implement fallback RPC nodes
3. Add connection timeout handling
4. Monitor network status

## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Key Management
```python
# Current (unsafe):
with open("private_keys.txt", "r") as f:
    private_keys = f.readlines()

# Recommended:
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
private_key = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")
```

### 2. Transaction Safety
```python
# Current (unsafe):
def swap_tokens(private_key, amount):
    # Direct transaction without checks
    pass

# Recommended:
def swap_tokens(private_key, amount):
    # Add safety checks
    if amount > MAX_AMOUNT:
        raise ValueError("Amount exceeds safety limit")
    
    # Add confirmation
    if not confirm_transaction(amount):
        raise UserCancelledError("Transaction cancelled by user")
```

### 3. Error Handling
```python
# Current (basic):
try:
    # Operation
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Recommended:
try:
    # Operation
except NetworkError as e:
    handle_network_error(e)
except ContractError as e:
    handle_contract_error(e)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(e)
    notify_admin(e)
```

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Implement encrypted key storage
- [ ] Add transaction limits
- [ ] Implement multi-signature support
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Add automated security testing

## Conclusion

This tool should only be used in a testnet environment with test tokens. Never use this tool with real funds or on mainnet without implementing proper security measures. The current implementation prioritizes functionality over security and should be enhanced before any production use.
